## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Doing this project helped me develop more with CSS Grid as when going through my code cademy modules I struggled due to the text only based learning style that they provide. 

### Continued development

I want to get a better grasp on CSS and Grids as I feel as if I still lack in this department and I am over a month into my coding journey now.
